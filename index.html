      <h2 class="main__title">Shadows of the past</h2>
      <p>I sit alone in my workshop, the smell of ink and parchment mingling with the faint chill of an Antwerp evening.
        My fingers trace the worn grooves of my printing press, the very tool that has shaped my life – and nearly ended
        it. The accusations still echo in my mind: Heretic, traitor. Words that burned hotter than the Spanish sun.</p>

      <p>It was not so long ago that I was forced to flee. A Calvinist pamphlet slipped unnoticed among my publications.
        The Spanish authorities were swift, unforgiving. I left Antwerp for Paris, leaving behind my presses, my
        livelihood…my family.</p>
      <p>run away</p>

      <p> For over a year, I lived in exile, scraping by as I waited for the storm to pass. But Antwerp called me back,
        and so I returned. My presses were spared, my name eventually cleared. Yet, even now, the shadows linger.</p>

    <section class="main__content">
      <h2 class="main__title">The weight of family</h2>
      <p>I think of my daughters. Margaretha, Martine, Catharina, Magdalena, and Henrica. Each one a reminder of why I
        must tread so carefully. What kind of future would they inherit if I dared to act against Spain? Their safety
        weighs heavily on me, as does the memory of my son Christoffel, gone too soon. Family is everything. And yet, is
        it enough to justify silence?</p>

      <h2 class="main__title">A dangerous vision</h2>
      <p>Then there is my craft. My presses hum with purpose, producing works that travel across the known world. Books
        of faith, knowledge, and beauty. But what if…what if these same presses could be wielded as weapons? What if my
        typefaces etched rebellion instead of reverence? Could I truly risk it? I imagine my presses dismantled,
        smuggled north to the Netherlands or beyond, churning out words that could ignite a fire against Spanish rule. A
        secret printing house, hidden in the shadows, where every page is a step closer to freedom. But would that
        freedom come at too great a cost?</p>
      <p>I glance at the locked chest in the corner of the room. Inside are drafts of pamphlets I dare not print. Not
        yet. Words sharp as swords, dangerous as gunpowder. I tell myself it is caution that stays my hand, but deep
        down, I know it is fear. Fear of what I could lose—and of what I could gain.</p>

      <h2>The silent echo</h2>
      <p>The night deepens, and I am left with my thoughts. Tomorrow, the sun will rise, and with it, new decisions to
        make. Will I risk everything to fight oppression? Or will I remain a loyal servant of the crown, the
        Arch-Printer of Spain, safe but complicit?</p>
      <p>The answer lies not in this room, but in the pages I leave behind. You must decide: did I dare to print the
        unprintable? Did I take the leap from loyal printer to rebel with a press? Visit the Museum Plantin-Moretus to
        uncover the truth of my story. My presses are silent now, but the echoes remain.</p>
