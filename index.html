          of an <span>Antwerp
            evening</span>.
          My fingers trace the worn grooves of my printing press, the very tool that has shaped my life – and nearly
          ended
          it. The accusations still echo in my mind: <span>Heretic, traitor</span>. Words that burned hotter than the
          Spanish sun.
        </p>
        <p class="paris__text">It was not so long ago that I was <span>forced to flee</span>. A Calvinist pamphlet
          slipped unnoticed
          among my
          publications.
          The Spanish authorities were swift, unforgiving. I left Antwerp for <span>Paris</span>, leaving behind my
          presses, my
          livelihood…my family.</p>

            back,
            and so I returned. My presses were spared, my name eventually cleared. Yet, even now, the shadows linger.

        <p>Then there is my craft. My presses hum with purpose, producing works that travel <span>across the known
            world</span>.
          Books
          of faith, knowledge, and beauty. But what if…what if these same presses could be wielded as weapons? What if
          my
          typefaces etched rebellion instead of reverence? Could I truly risk it? I imagine my presses dismantled,
          smuggled north to the Netherlands or beyond, churning out words that could <span> ignite a fire against
            Spanish rule</span>.
          A
          secret printing house, hidden in the shadows, where every page is a step closer to freedom. But would that
          freedom come at too great a cost?</p>

            yet. Words sharp as swords, dangerous as gunpowder. I tell myself it is caution that stays my hand, but deep
            down, I know it is fear. Fear of what I could lose—and of what I could gain.</p>
